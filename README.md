## Abstract

How do infants become word meaning experts? This registered report investigated the structure of infants’ early lexical representations by manipulating the typicality of exemplars from familiar animal categories. 14- to 18-month-old infants (N=84; 51 female; M=15.7 months; race/ethnicity: 64% White, 8% Asian, 2% Hispanic, 1% Black, 23% multiple categories) were tested on their ability to recognize typical and atypical category exemplars after hearing familiar basic-level category labels. Infants robustly recognized both typical (d=0.79, 95% CI [0.54, 1.03]) and atypical (d=0.73, 95% CI [0.48, 0.97]) exemplars, with no significant difference between typicality conditions (d=0.13, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.35]). These results support a broad-to-narrow account of infants’ early word meanings. Implications for the role of experience in the development of lexical knowledge are discussed.

## Details on individual folders

Below are more detailed explanations of individual folder components

### Data Analysis

This folder contains the data anad analysis scripts for both the pilot and the registered report experiment.

### Figures

The main figures included in the registered report.

### Lookit Experiments

This folder includes the main stimuli and trial information used in the Lookit experiments reported in the registered report

### LWL Experiment Demo

Demo of experiment testing word recognition for typical and atypical exemplars in a looking-while-listening paradigm.

### Norming: Nameability and Typicality Ratings

The folder *norming* contains experimental scripts for collecting stimulus ratings, data, and analysis scripts.

- [typicality ratings demo](https://mzettersten.github.io/lwl_typ_animals/norming/norming_experiments/typical_animals/typical_animals.html)

### Stimuli

Repository containing images of typical and atypical category members (current categories: bird, cat, dog, fish). This is the full set of images that were included in our norming studies, not the final set of images used in the experiment in the Registered Report. For the final images used in the registered report, see the folder **lwl_experiment_demo** > **stimuli** > **images**
