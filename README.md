**Abstract**

How do infants become word meaning experts? This registered report investigated the structure of infants’ early lexical representations by manipulating the typicality of exemplars from familiar animal categories. 14- to 18-month-old infants (N=84; 51 female; M=15.7 months; race/ethnicity: 64% White, 8% Asian, 2% Hispanic, 1% Black, 23% multiple categories) were tested on their ability to recognize typical and atypical category exemplars after hearing familiar basic-level category labels. Infants robustly recognized both typical (d=0.79, 95% CI [0.54, 1.03]) and atypical (d=0.73, 95% CI [0.48, 0.97]) exemplars, with no significant difference between typicality conditions (d=0.13, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.35]). These results support a broad-to-narrow account of infants’ early word meanings. Implications for the role of experience in the development of lexical knowledge are discussed.

## Details on individual folders

Below are more detailed explanations of individual folder components

### Data Analysis

This folder contains the data anad analysis scripts for both the pilot and the registered report experiment.

* **registered_report**: contains the data and analysis scripts for the main experiment in the registered report.
    * **analysis/figures**: Figures generated by the analysis scripts
    * **analysis/manuscript**: Main analysis scripts
      - (**0_preprocessing.Rmd**): Step 0 in the processing pipeline - all sensitive information is handled and deanonymized in this preprocessing step (currently omitted on GitHub)
      - **1_process_looking_data.Rmd**: Step 1 in the processing pipeline - all of the main processing of the looking data and integration with metadata is handled during this step
      - **2_process_exclusions.Rmd**: Step 2 in the processing pipeline - the processing of exclusions happens in this step
      - **categories_dreamsim_distances.R**: Data file for evaluating properties of the DreamSim distances data (not currently used - planned for additional exploratory analyses)
      - **CATegories_main_data_codebook.csv**: Codebook for the main CATegories data file (including exclusion information
      - **cluster_permutation_analysis.html**: HTML render of the R markdown for performing cluster-based permutation analyses
      - **cluster_permutation_analysis.Rmd**: R markdown for performing cluster-based permutation analyses
      - **common.R**: script for commonly used R functions
      - **compute_iccs.R**: function for computing intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)
      - **compute_rt.R**: script for computing reaction times (in particular the data file **CATegories_exp2_RT_by_trial.csv**
      - **images**: folder containing all (normed) images - used to generate figures in the main analyses
      - **main_analysis.html**: HTML render of the main analysis R markdown script
      - **main_analysis.Rmd**: main analysis R markdown script
      - **manuscript.Rproj**: R project file for the main analyses
      - **process_frame_data.R**: script for processing Lookit frame data (logs) - this scripts generates **CATegories_exp2_processed_frame_data.csv**
      - **resampling_helper.R**: script containing main R functions for resampling looking data
      - **rt_helper.R**: script containing main R function for computing reactions times
    * **data/processed_data**: This folder contains all of the main data files for the Registered Report experiment
      - **animal_ratings_stimuli_full.csv**: Metadata file containing information about each image and image name.
      - **CATegories_analysis_window_frame_ranges.csv**: Trial-by-trial analyzed frame ranges for each participant and session (used in computing reliability)
      - **categories_dreamsim_image_pairwise_distances.csv**: Pairwise distances between images computed using DreamSim (https://dreamsim-nights.github.io/). Smaller distances correspond to higher similarity, as estimated by the DreamSim model
      - **CATegories_exclusion_info.csv**: Summary of participant-level exclusions
      - **CATegories_exp2_peyecoder_data_anonymized.csv**: The manually coded frame-by-frame looking data, removing deanonymizing information
      - **CATegories_exp2_processed_data_resampled.csv**: Frame-by-frame looking data resampled to one consistent frame rate (15 Hz)
