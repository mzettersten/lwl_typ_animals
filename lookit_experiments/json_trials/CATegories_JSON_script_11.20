Your baby saw some pictures of animals that they are more likely to have seen before (i.e., a golden retriever), while others were more unusual (i.e., a basset hound). We wonder if babies will recognize the atypical animals as quickly as the typical animals.</br></br>Babies know more about words than they are able to say, so we look at what babies <i>understand</i> about words by seeing what they look at during the study. There are many reasons why your baby might look to one kind of animal over another, and your baby likely looked at pictures differently than another child based on their unique experiences with these animals. For example, your baby may not know the word <i>fish</i> or maybe you have a golden retriever at home that looks like the one in our study. Thatâ€™s totally okay! We average across many babies and many different trials to understand how babies, on average, learn that words refer to categories of things.</br></br>Once we have checked that your consent video meets our eligibility criteria, we will send you a $5 gift card as a thank you! You can expect to receive the gift card within about a week of participating.</br></br>You can learn more about our research <a href='https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>on the Infant Learning Lab website</a> or by checking us out in the First Words episode of <a href='https://www.netflix.com/title/80117833' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Netflixâ€™s Babies docuseries</a>.
